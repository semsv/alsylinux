Introduction to GCC

The GCC package contains the GNU Compiler Collection. This page describes the installation of compilers for the following languages: C, C++, Fortran, Objective C, Objective C++, and Go. One additional language, Ada, is available in the collection. It has specific requirements, so it is described in a separate page (GCC-Ada-7.3.0). Since C and C++ are installed in LFS, this page is either for upgrading C and C++, or for installing additional compilers.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-8.2 platform.
